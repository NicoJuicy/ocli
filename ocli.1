.SH NAME
ocli \- OwnTracks command-line interface GPS publisher
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ocli
[
.IR parameter-file ... ]
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ocli
is the OwnTracks command line interface publisher, a small utility which connects to
.B gpsd
(the interface daemon for GPS receivers )
and publishes position information in OwnTracks JSON format to an MQTT broker in order
for compatible software to process location data.

.B ocli
reads GPS data from an installed
.B gpsd
daemon, and as soon as it has a fix it publishes an OwnTracks payload.
.B ocli
will subsequently publish a message every \fCOCLI_INTERVAL\fR seconds or when it detects it has moved \fCOCLI_DISPLACEMENT\fR meters.
.PP
.B ocli
operates with a number of defaults which you can override using environment variables.
.PP
Any number of path names can be passed as
.I parameter-file
arguments to
.B ocli
which interprets each in terms of an element which will be added to the OwnTracks JSON. The element name is the base name of the path. If a path points to an executable file the first line of
standard output produced by that executable will be used as the key's value, otherwise the first line read from the file. In both cases, trailing newlines are removed from values.

.ft CW
echo 27.2 > temperature
ocli temperature /usr/bin/uname
.ft

.sp
will produce a payload which might look like
.nf
.in 1i
.ft CW
{
  "_type": "location",
  "tst": 1577654651,
  "lat": 48.856826,

  "temp" : "27.2",
  "platform": "FreeBSD"
}
.ft
.in
.fi
.PP
Keys obtained from
.IR parameter-file s
must not overwrite JSON element names define by
.BR ocli ,
so, for example, a file called \fClat\fR will be silently ignored as it would clobber the JSON
\fClatitude\fR element.
.PP
It is possible to control
.B ocli
using a subset of OwnTrack's \fCcmd\fR commands.

mosquitto_pub -t $t -m "$(jo _type=cmd action=reportLocation)"
.fi
.in

.sp
The following commands are currently implemented:
.IP reportLocation 1i
causes
.B ocli
to publish its current location (providing
.B gpsd
has a fix).
.B ocli
sets \fCt:m\fR in the JSON to indicate the publish was manually requested.
.IP dump 1i
causes the program to publish its internal configuration to the topic \fC\fIbasetopic\fR\fC/dump\fR as a \fC_type: configuration\fR message.
.IP setConfiguration
permits setting some of
.BR ocli 's
internal values (\fClocatorInterval\fR and \fClocatorDisplacement\fR).
Note that these do not persist a restart.
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B ocli
is operates with a number of compiled-in defaults which can be overridden using environment variables:
.IP \fCBASE_TOPIC\fR 1i
The MQTT base topic defaults to \fCowntracks/\fIusername\fR\fC/\fIhostname\fR, where
.I username
is the name of the logged in user, and
.I hostname
the short host name.
.IP \fCMQTT_HOST\fR 1i
The MQTT host defaults to \fClocalhost\fR.
.IP \fCMQTT_PORT\fR 1i
The MQTT port is \fC1883\fR.
.IP \fCOCLI_CLIENTID\fR 1i
The MQTT clientId is set to \fC"ocli-\fIusername\fR\fC-\fIhostname\fR\fC"\fR.
.IP \fCGPSD_HOST\fR 1i
The address/hostname of the host on which
.B gpsd
is listening defaults to \fClocalhost\fR.
.IP \fCGPSD_PORT\fR 1i
The
.B gpsd
port nummber defaults to \fC2947\fR.
.IP \fCOCLI_TID\fR 1i
The two-letter OwnTracks tracker ID defaults to not being used.
.IP \fCOCLI_INTERVAL\fR 1i
The interval after which
.B ocli
will publish a location position defaults to 60 seconds and can be changed dynamically (see above).
.IP \fCOCLI_DISPLACEMENT\fR 1i
The distance after which
.B ocli
will publish a location position defaults to 0 meters and can be changed dynamically (see above).
.IP \fCOCLI_CACERT\fR 1i
The path to a PEM-encoded CA certificate which
.B ocli
uses to enable TLS/SSL.It is likely that the default MQTT port will need to be changed at the same time.
